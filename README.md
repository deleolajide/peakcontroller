# PeakController

This a specialised Chrome Web App that lets me use a Peak Guitar Hero controller to play a Yamaha QY100 live via a UXC-16 Midi controller and LPK25 midi keyboard to set the song key for the chord progressions.

I use the QY100 to provide live backing music to play the RealGuitar software from Musiclabs 

It is based on the [GuitarHeroClone](https://github.com/aparkins/GuitarHeroClone) GitHub project by Aric Parkinson

It uses the chord to button mapping shown in the screenshot below.
